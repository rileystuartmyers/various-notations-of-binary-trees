By using stacks and queues, a statement consisting of multiplication/division/add/sub operations, which can be in prefix/postfix/infix form, is evaluated.

Inputs are read in groups of two: 

  - The first line consists of clarification for the next line, and can be 'prefix', 'postfix',  or 'infix'.

  - For the second line, a math statement is given with any number of parentheses, asterisks, forward-slashes, '-' signs, and   '+' signs.

Output is given after evaluating the math statement line, and gives the product of that line.


Example:

(Input) - infix
          16 - 1 * (( 2 ^ 2 ) ^ 3 )

(Output) - 0.25
